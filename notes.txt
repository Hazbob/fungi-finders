important to make a plan of attack and make as much reusable as possible

look at the figma/design and look for the possible similarities

css reset to make browser differences redundant

webkit text size adjust - an old mobile feature that switches up font size if someone is viewing your webist in landscape
on mobile

text wrap pretty, stops orphan words from paragraphs

you can explicitly declare layers in css, by doing @layer name1, name2, name3...

specificity and inheritance

naming colours, start with a clr(colour) ff- font family fs-font size => then the name, 

avoid using pixels for font sizes, he recommends to use REM instead. This is because em or rem, will map itself to user
preferences

custom properties are the same as css variables. Kev said, yeah its a lot of work setting these up, but for the bigger picture, its a good thing, so its important to plan it out and implement it in the project

do as much with base styles to avoid writing more css later someone

base styles are the one that set the stage for the rest of the project

he thinks a lot about accessibility, 

links that just say things like "Learn more", are not useful. so what he does is add a visually hidden span in the html for the link, which has text explaining what that link does

there is a bigger focus on accessibility than i thought there would be, it makes sense and is satisfying to do so.

i dont need to rememeber the class for a11y, a common name for the class that we called visually hidden in this is sr-only. easy google to find this again.
