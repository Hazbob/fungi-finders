these are classes similar to tailwind. reusable baked in css

he mentions that overdoing it with utilities can be a negative thing, especially if not working with component based JS framework.

take time before starting working on the css, to think about all of the cases where you might be able to create reusable utility classes.

one of the things that he identifies as a potential utility, is from the similarity of all of the paragraphs, sometimes the fontsize might change, or the colour.

he looks for the similarities where there are very small differences when deciding to create utilities.

utility classes from what i can tell are a useful way to have re-usable css, in a declarative way, for example: .background-dark would be a class that implements background-color: var(--background-dark)
